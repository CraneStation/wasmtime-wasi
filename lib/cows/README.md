This is the `wasmtime-cows` crate, which implements the
Capability-Oriented WebAssembly Syscalls (COWS) API.

COWS is greatly inspired by and directly derived from [CloudABI].
It differs in that it has aspirations to expand to a greater
scope, and to better support the needs of WebAssembly engines.
