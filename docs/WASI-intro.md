# Welcome to WASI!

WASI stands for WebAssembly System Interface. It's an API designed by
the [Wasmtime] project that provides access to several operating-system-like
features, including files and filesystems, Berkeley sockets, clocks, and
random numbers, that we'll be proposing for standardization.

It's designed to be independent of browsers, so it doesn't depend on
Web APIs or JS, and isn't limited by the need to be compatible with JS.
And it has integrated capability-based security, so it extends
WebAssembly's characteristic sandboxing to include I/O.

See the [WASI Overview](WASI-overview.md) for more detailed background
information.

Note that everything here is a prototype, and while a lot of stuff works,
there are numerous missing features and some rough edges. One big thing
that's not done yet is the actual mechanism to provide a directory as a
pre-opened capability, to allow files to be opened. Some of the pieces
are there (`__wasilibc_register_preopened_fd`) but they're not used yet.
Networking support is also incomplete.

## How can I write programs that use WASI?

The two toolchains that currently work well are the Rust toolchain and
a specially packaged C and C++ toolchain. Of course, we hope other
toolchains will be able to implement WASI as well!

### Rust

To install a WASI-enabled Rust toolchain, follow the instructions here:

https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/releases/tag/wasi2

Until now, Rust's WebAssembly support has had two main options, the
Emscripten-based option, and the wasm32-unknown-unknown option. The latter
option is lighter-weight, but only supports `no_std`. WASI enables a new
wasm32-unknown-wasi target, which is similar to wasm32-unknown-unknown in
that it doesn't depend on Emscripten, but it can use WASI to provide a
decent subset of libstd.

### C/C++

All the parts needed to support wasm are included in upstream clang, lld, and
compiler-rt, as of the LLVM 8.0 release. However, to use it, you'll need
to build WebAssembly-targeted versions of the library parts, and it can
be tricky to get all the CMake invocations lined up properly.

To make things easier, we provide
[prebuilt packages](https://github.com/CraneStation/wasi-sdk/releases)
that provide builds of Clang and sysroot libraries.

Note that there are currently some
[bugs](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40412) in clang which affect
libcxx, so things like <iostream> don't work yet.

## How can I run programs that use WASI?

Currently the options are [Wasmtime], [Lucet], and the browser polyfill.

[Lucet]: https://github.com/fastly/lucet/

### Wasmtime

[Wasmtime] is a non-Web WebAssembly engine which is part of the
[CraneStation project](https://github.com/CraneStation/). To build
it, download the code and build with `cargo build --release`. It can
run WASI-using wasm programs by simply running `wasmtime foo.wasm`,
or `cargo run --bin wasmtime foo.wasm`.

### The browser polyfill

This isn't packaged up neatly yet, but the pieces are
[here](https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime-wasi/tree/wasi/lib/wasi/sandboxed-system-primitives/polyfill).

TODO: Make this easier to use.

## Where can I learn more?

Beyond the [WASI Overview](WASI-overview.md), take a look at the
various [WASI documents](WASI-documents.md).
